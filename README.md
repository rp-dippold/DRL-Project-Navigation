# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Project-Navigation

## Project Details
This project is based on a Unity environment to design, train, and evaluate deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
The environment used in this project is a large square world which contains blue and yellow bananas.

An agent is trained to navigate in this world and to collect as much yellow bananas as possible and to avoid blue bananas.
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes. To make it a little bit more challenging, the average score to be attained was set to +16.

### Installation and Dependencies

The code of this project was tested on Linux and Windows 11. To get the code running on your local system, follow these steps
which are base on Anaconda and pip:

1.  `conda create --name banana python=3.8 -c conda-forge`
2.  `conda activate banana`
3.  `[ONLY WINDOWS] conda install swig -c conda-forge`
4.  Create a directory where you want this save this project
5.  `git clone https://github.com/rp-dippold/DRL-Project-Navigation.git`
6.  `cd python`
7.  `pip install .`
8.  `python -m ipykernel install --user --name banana --display-name "banana"`
9.  Install Pytorch:
    * [CPU]: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio`
    * [GPU]: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117`.\
    Depending on your GPU and cudnn version a different pytorch version my be required. Please refer to 
    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
